This “immutability” is due to a combination of factors including the cryptography used in a blockchain, its consensus/validation mechanism and its distributed nature. As a result of this immutability, blockchain systems can be used as an independent umpire in processes that might otherwise expose participants to the risk of one party not living up to its contractual obligations (counterparty risk) and where third-party guarantors are reluctant to intervene and assume part of that risk.</p></clause>

For example, Bitcoin, a public blockchain, uses Proof of Work algorithms which allow miners to recover the cost of computationally expensive work in exchange for transaction fees and these fees also provide a way to initially put coins into circulation. Permissioned ledgers use a consortium of collectively trusted, but not necessarily individually trusted, nodes to agree on the output of a consensus process—which is generally cheaper and faster than Bitcoin’s Proof of Work. All consensus processes require a mechanism to settle disputes, or uncertainty, about which block should be written next. Most of these mechanisms are based upon using the block, which is agreed upon by more than 50% of the nodes. A more detailed description of public and permissioned blockchains can be found below.</p></clause>

For example, mining the creation of blocks has deliberately been made expensive. This protects the blockchain by making the cost of capturing more than 50% of the nodes—the number needed to approve a block, and thus to manipulate the blockchain—prohibitively expensive. To compensate for this cost, miners are rewarded both an amount of Bitcoin for each block they create and fees for each transaction written to the blockchain<fn reference="5"><p id="_ed584371-f123-4f17-944c-dd0d3d1445d5">Bitcoin is designed so that, over time, mining rewards are reduced with the objective of eventually having all mining rewards come from transaction fees.</p></fn>. Each block has a size limit and transaction costs are determined on a free-market basis, so the more transactions are requested, the more the price increases for each transaction. This is necessary for the Bitcoin economic operating model, which seeks to obtain an honest consensus in an unregulated market of potentially anonymous and economically rational operators (i.e. operators who might, being anonymous, and having no costs for doing so, steal assets). As an additional incentive, if a node/miner does not accept the block voted on by over 50% of the other nodes, it is effectively kicked off the blockchain, thus losing the possibility of earning future Bitcoins and transaction fees. Consequently, Bitcoin has extremely low bandwidth due to the cost of generating blocks with transactions taking on average 10 minutes to be confirmed. In addition, its very large number of nodes and users, generating large amounts of data, together with its block-size limits, makes storing data on the Bitcoin blockchain expensive as well as being inefficient.</p></clause>

For example, because they have more control over who participates, permissioned ledgers can use other consensus mechanisms—even if some of them are somewhat less robust than the Proof of Work used by Bitcoin. For example, there are consensus mechanisms based on the amount a node has invested in a network (called Proof of Stake), or where a consensus by a subset of nodes is verified by a larger group.</p></clause>

For example, if you click on a link on a television news website, which changes on a regular basis as it is updated, what you find tomorrow may be different from what you find today.

Supplementary data can either be in public/open distributed data systems such as the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS)—an open, content-addressable memory that uses standard internet protocols—or it may reference data in private databases that are selectively available to permissioned ledger users. With private off-chain or cross-chain references, it is possible for network operators to know that some data exists, but to have their access limited by additional controls. This can be very interesting from a privacy standpoint as it is possible to access data in order to know that, for example, someone is over 21 without giving their age, or that they live in London, without giving their address.</p></clause>

Nonetheless, IoT devices tend not to be used directly as oracles because of security concerns, and because systems that are connected to tens of thousands of IoT devices might be overwhelmed by data volumes. Also, writing constant data readings to a blockchain could be expensive for those networks where every time you write data you have to pay a small amount.

During shipment an IoT device in a container records that the fruit was kept at 0 degrees Celsius for 2 entire days. This information is given to the smart contract which notifies the insurance company that a payment should be made to the exporter to compensate for the goods destroyed by the excessively low temperature and that payment is automatically made by the smart contract without any further intervention by either the importer, the exporter or the transport company. This significantly decreases the cost for insurance companies of processing claims because they do not have to reconcile information submitted by the shipper/exporter with the insurance policy, evaluate the truth of the insurance claim (the IoT data provided the proof) and then request payment. In addition, it reduces the costs for the shipper/exporter as they do not have to undertake any further documentation of the problem which occurred, and they receive their insurance payment more quickly.</p></clause></clause>
