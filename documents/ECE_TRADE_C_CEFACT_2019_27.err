Many paper forms will request specific information such as consignor or consignee, which provides a certain structure; however, depending on the business context and which stakeholder is questioned, such information can be interpreted differently by any recipient. Some paper forms will provide a specific number of spaces: for example, allowing a maximum of three letters (for Yes or No), In this case, responding to a question with “it depends” will exceed the space and should not be possible. The UN Layout Key as defined in UNECE Recommendation 1 describes a way of harmonizing paper document layouts to maximize standardized reading of the data across international trade paper documents. Whilst this has helped since its introduction in the 1970s, it remains a manual human process to access the data, i.e. the data cannot be automatically processed.</p></clause>

If there are multiple partners each has their own data exchange syntax, then each one requires a separate mapping. If there is information that is not clearly defined in a data exchange, approximations must be made; these can later cause problems if the type of information they contain is not harmonized. Any change in a message requires an update of the mappings. The syntax must therefore be constantly looked after.</p></clause>

When faced with new messages which do not align exactly to their version of syntax, the Information Technology (IT) staff within an organization will simply proceed to develop the required mappings. Since many decision makers do not realize what this work entails, they simply trust their computer divisions to do the necessary work. The more data-exchange partners an organization has, the more staff is required to develop and maintain these mappings. This pulls resources away from the core activities of a business in order to deal with an aspect of their business which is purely administrative and costly to the bottom line.</p></clause>

This is basing the correlations on ontologies, or relationships between data. In theory, this can be achieved. However, enormous amounts of data are necessary to ensure that the links between different message structures are correct. For common information available on most commercial exchanges, such as traders’ names and addresses, this may be easy to establish. Less frequent information is less likely to be correctly understood. And again, each time there is a change in the message structure on the sending or receiving side, the computer learning will need to re-establish the connections after reaching a critical mass of data.</p></clause></clause>

However, much of the WTO TFA refers to electronic exchanges of information and, in light of this, the use of standards will also refer to electronic data-exchange standards.</p></clause>

The time required for processing a transit declaration manually through a paper document will take several hours, if not days, whereas processing it electronically can take a matter of seconds. This is true of almost all border procedures. But in order to gain the benefits of electronic data exchanges, globally harmonized semantic standards must be adopted.</p></clause>

For this reason, most government-run electronic systems will dictate the data to be submitted. This is often defined with national or regional legally mandated regulatory requirements in mind and these may or may not be based on international semantic standards. In contrast, the private sector will often define their data exchange requirements based on the business processes needed to support their trading (not necessarily regulations). This means that when traders are connecting to regulatory systems, they are forced to do a mapping from their trading data semantics to the regulatory data semantics of the government. As with the bridges described above, this can result in misinterpretations and mis-mappings that can be unintentionally (or possibly undetectably intentionally) detrimental to risk assessment and evaluations.</p></clause>

UN/CEFACT was established with such a mission in mind. The “FACT” part of UN/CEFACT comes from “UN/EDIFACT”, which means the United Nations Electronic Data Interchange For Administration, Commerce and Transport. UN/CEFACT was established with both the public sector (administrations) and the private sector (commerce and transport) in mind.
